 * Total Submissions: 16.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '[4,3,10,9,8]'
 *
 * Given the array nums, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of
 * elements is strictly greater than the sum of the nonÂ included elements in
 * such subsequence.
 *
 * If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with minimum size
 * and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the
 * maximum total sum of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be
 * obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.
 *
 * Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be
 * unique. Also return the answer sorted in non-increasing order.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
 * Output: [10,9]
 * Explanation: The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the
 * sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not
 * included, however, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its
 * elements.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]
 * Output: [7,7,6]
 * Explanation: The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14
 * which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4
 * + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the
 * conditions. Note the subsequence has to returned in non-decreasing
 * order.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [6]
 * Output: [6]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 500
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
